## Project Overview

This project is a HubSpot integration that manages a custom object called **Car** (in Portuguese, “Carro”). Each car record has the following properties:

- `name`: The full name of the car (e.g., "Fiat Palio 1.0")
- `marca`: The brand (e.g., "Fiat")
- `modelo`: The model (e.g., "Palio 1.0")

Users can:
- View a list of all cars
- Create a new car
- Edit existing cars

These actions interact directly with the HubSpot CRM API using a Private App Token.
